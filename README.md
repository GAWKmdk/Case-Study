# Case-Study

This was to be the start on the "out-of-the-box" Corporate blog template assignment using Meteor JS, put on by the Coursera.org - University of London - Responsive Web Development course. But since half way into week 2, the course required I install their git hub example - which happens to currently be heavily layered in bower dependencies and back-end versioning-glint topped off with a final glaze of server-sided coffeescript - I dropped the course.

I wanted to keep my blog simple with minimal dependencies and version-splitting, so this is now just a simple navbar + routers model for a future MDV frame model.

If you wanna DE-tangle their version build --- https://github.com/meteor-blog/meteor-blog --- may the farce be with ya.
